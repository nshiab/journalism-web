# The Journalism Library (web functions)

Useful TypeScript functions for journalism projects. This library focuses on
functions that rely on specific web browser features. It's part of the
[journalism library](https://github.com/nshiab/journalism).

The library is available on [JSR](https://jsr.io/@nshiab/journalism-web) with
its [documentation](https://jsr.io/@nshiab/journalism-web/doc).

The documentation is also available as the markdown file
[llm.md](https://github.com/nshiab/journalism-web/blob/main/llm.md), which can
be passed as context to improve the use of the library by AI coding assistants
or agents.

The library is maintained by [Nael Shiab](http://naelshiab.com/), computational
journalist and senior data producer for [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news).
